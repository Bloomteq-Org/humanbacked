HumanBacked White Paper
Proof of Personhood + Verified Support for the AI Era

This white paper describes the HumanBacked product vision and a conceptual system design.
Features, specifications, and timelines may evolve during testing with creators and partners.

Executive Summary
The creator economy is entering a trust crisis. AI-generated content, deepfakes, and
impersonation accounts are growing faster than platforms can respond. The result is
predictable: creators get copied, audiences get scammed, brands hesitate to partner, and
authentic work gets drowned out by fake engagement.
HumanBacked solves a simple, high-value problem:
Prove a real human is behind a creator account, then make that trust usable.
HumanBacked delivers two connected layers that reinforce each other:
1. Verification Layer (Proof of Personhood): A privacy-first verification process that
produces a clear, checkable trust signal.
2. Support Layer (Verified Support): A safe way for audiences to support verified
creators, anchored to identity and community trust, not hype.
The Support Layer is not “tips for tips’ sake.” It is the action layer that turns trust into real
outcomes: safer fan support, stronger community connection, better conversion for creator
monetization, and reduced fraud for partners.
HumanBacked is built for creators, and designed to integrate with platforms, brands, and
marketplaces as a trust and risk-reduction layer.

1. The Problem: Trust Is Breaking Online
Digital identity used to be based on consistency. If a creator posted for years, had followers, and
seemed real, people trusted them. That assumption is no longer reliable.
What changed
 AI makes it cheap and fast to generate convincing faces, voices, and content.
 Impersonation scales across platforms in hours, not weeks.
 Bot engagement creates fake credibility and false social proof.

 Audiences cannot quickly confirm who is real.
Why this matters
The damage is not only reputational. It becomes financial the moment support is involved.
Impersonators do not stop at fake posts. They move toward high-trust actions: DMs, fake links,
“exclusive access,” fake giveaways, fake memberships, and “support me here” pages. Support
is where scams hit hardest because audiences are trying to back a person.
Creators pay twice: lost trust from scams, and lost opportunities when brands and platforms
hesitate due to identity uncertainty. Even loyal supporters start to second guess.
The internet needs a trust layer that is easy to verify and safe to act on.

2. HumanBacked: The Trust and Support Layer
HumanBacked is designed to answer one question clearly:
Is this the real creator, backed by a verified human identity?
Then it enables the next step:
If I want to support them, can I do it safely and meaningfully?
HumanBacked is not trying to rank creators or judge content quality. It is not a popularity score.
It is a credibility layer that is grounded in one thing: real human identity, verified and checkable.

3. Who HumanBacked Is For
Creators
Artists, comedians, musicians, educators, streamers, niche experts, and any creator who wants
a simple way to prove authenticity and protect their name.
Creators want:
 A clear “this is me” trust signal
 Protection against impersonation and AI copycats
 A trusted link they can share anywhere
 A support experience that strengthens community, not just revenue
Audiences
Fans who want to engage and support without being fooled.
Audiences want:
 One-click confidence that they found the real creator
 A safe way to support real human work

 Less confusion during viral growth and copycat waves
Partners
Platforms, brands, and marketplaces that need better identity assurance and lower fraud.
Partners want:
 Reduced impersonation and payout fraud
 Faster, safer creator onboarding
 A privacy-first verification layer that is easy to integrate

4. Product Overview
4.1 Verification Layer: Proof of Personhood
HumanBacked verifies that a real human is behind a creator identity. The output is a verification
credential with:
 an issuance date
 an expiration policy
 a revocation mechanism
 a public verification view that does not expose sensitive data
Key idea: Trust should be portable and checkable, not a vague claim.
4.2 Verification Page: A Trusted Home Base
Creators receive a shareable verification page that is designed to:
 confirm authenticity quickly
 reduce impersonation effectiveness
 give audiences one official place to verify and support
This becomes the creator’s “trust link,” especially useful when impersonators spin up clones and
fake pages.
4.3 Support Layer: Verified Support, Not Just Payments
HumanBacked connects support to verified identity so audiences can back the real person with
confidence.
Support is not only money. It is a trust action that reinforces community. HumanBacked is
designed so support can include:
 tips or direct contributions (where enabled)
 recognition and community signals

 perks or access tied to verification (optional)
 partner-backed benefits (optional)
The point: Verified support makes authentic content more sustainable and makes scams less
effective.
What audiences get
 Confidence they are supporting the real creator
 A simple, low-friction support flow
 A clearer “human-made” signal during moments of uncertainty
What creators get
 A safer path to support that they can share everywhere
 Higher trust that improves conversion across memberships, merch, tickets, and
partnerships
 Reduced scam risk tied to their name
 A stronger community loop that rewards consistency and authenticity
Even when a supporter never pays, the trust signal improves outcomes. Verified identity
increases confidence, and confidence increases engagement.
4.4 Partner Integrations
HumanBacked can integrate into partner workflows through a verification API and event
updates.
Common partner uses:
 verify creators before onboarding and payouts
 reduce impersonation and brand risk
 confirm identity before sponsorships and collaborations
 provide safer user experiences on marketplaces and platforms

5. How It Works (Conceptual)
Step 1: Creator Onboarding
A creator creates a HumanBacked profile and links their public creator presence.
Step 2: Proof of Personhood Verification
HumanBacked verifies the creator using a privacy-first process. The goal is to confirm a real
person and prevent automation, replay, and mass farming.
Step 3: Credential Issuance

A verification credential is issued with clear status handling: valid, expired, revoked.
Step 4: Public Verification Page
The creator shares one trusted link that audiences and partners can check.
Step 5: Verified Support
Audiences can support the verified creator through a flow tied to the verification page, reducing
the chance of impersonation interception.

6. Design Principles: Privacy, Safety, and Trust
Privacy-first by design
 Data minimization: collect only what is needed
 Derived signals over raw sensitive data where possible
 Strong access controls and audit logging
 Clear user consent and transparency
Purpose limitation
Verification data should not be repurposed for ads, profiling, or unrelated targeting.
Fairness and accessibility
Verification should be usable across diverse creator contexts, with clear support paths when
verification fails.

7. Threat Model and Fraud Defense
HumanBacked is built assuming adversaries will attempt to scale fraud.
Key threats:
 impersonation using stolen content and deepfakes
 bot farms attempting mass onboarding
 replay and scripted attacks
 credential theft and account takeover
 social engineering of creators and support staff
Defense approach (conceptual):
 anti-automation controls and rate limiting
 anomaly detection and risk scoring
 step-up checks when suspicious activity is detected

 credential expiry and revocation
 audit logs for sensitive actions
The goal is not perfection. The goal is to make fraud expensive, slow, and detectable.

8. The Business Value
For creators
 authenticity protection that is easy to share
 stronger trust that improves monetization conversion everywhere
 safer support that reduces impersonation losses
 better credibility with brands and platforms
For audiences
 less uncertainty, fewer scams
 easier and safer support of real human work
 clearer signals in a noisy, AI-heavy environment
For partners
 reduced fraud and support burden
 safer onboarding and payout processes
 improved platform trust and brand safety
 a practical trust signal that can be verified programmatically
Business model (high level)
HumanBacked is designed to support multiple revenue paths without compromising trust:
 creator subscription tiers for enhanced features
 partner integrations and verification services
 optional take-rate on verified support flows (where applicable)
 enterprise risk and fraud tooling for platforms and marketplaces
HumanBacked prioritizes trust first. Monetization should reinforce trust, not weaken it.

9. Roadmap (High Level)
Phase 1: Verification Foundation
 creator onboarding

 Proof of Personhood verification
 verification credential lifecycle (valid, expired, revoked)
 public verification page
Phase 2: Support Layer MVP
 verified support link flow
 creator support dashboard (basic insights and signals)
 anti-fraud controls specific to support interception and impersonation
Phase 3: Partner Pilots
 partner API gateway and status webhooks
 onboarding verification integrations
 brand and marketplace pilots with real creators
 optional perks and trust-based benefits tied to verification
Phase 4: Scale and Interoperability
 broader integrations across creator tools and platforms
 portable verification credentials where feasible
 expanded support experiences beyond payments (recognition, perks, access)

Conclusion
The future of the internet is not only synthetic. It is human.
HumanBacked exists to protect real creators and make authenticity easy to verify. Verification
without action is not enough. That is why HumanBacked combines Proof of Personhood with
Verified Support, so audiences can back real human work confidently, creators can grow
sustainably, and partners can reduce fraud and risk.
HumanBacked is the trust and support layer for the AI era.
